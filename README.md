# Project 3 - Application of numerical methods to differential equations #
### *Project as part of the subject of ordinary differential equations - 12.05.2022* ###

### Task description ###

We consider the following differential equation:

$\large \dot{x} = xt^{-1} - 5t^2x^3$ with an initial condition $\large x(1)=1$

* Obtain a numerical approximation of the solution to this equation on the range $[1,5]$ using the following method from Runge Kutta.
* Determine the order of convergence of the methods obtained in the simulations by examining errors in nodes with the method used in laboratories.
* Select the appropriate initial number of knots and perform enough compaction until the compaction error reduction stabilizes.
* Make a drawing comparing the exact solution and the calculated approximations.

### Python packages used ###

* ```matplotlib.pyplot```
* ```numpy```
* ```sympy```
